# Simple Java Mail #

Simple Java Mail is the simplest to use lightweight mailing library for Java, while being able to send complex emails including **[CLI support](https://www.simplejavamail.org/cli.html#navigation)**, **[authenticated socks proxy](https://www.simplejavamail.org/features.html#section-proxy)**(!), **[attachments](https://www.simplejavamail.org/features.html#section-attachments)**, **[embedded images](https://www.simplejavamail.org/features.html#section-embedding)**, **[custom headers and properties](https://www.simplejavamail.org/features.html#section-custom-headers)**, **[robust address validation](https://www.simplejavamail.org/features.html#section-email-validation)**, **[build pattern](https://www.simplejavamail.org/features.html#section-builder-api)** and even **[DKIM signing](https://www.simplejavamail.org/features.html#section-dkim)**, **[S/MIME support](https://www.simplejavamail.org/features.html#section-sending-smime)** and **[external configuration files](https://www.simplejavamail.org/configuration.html#section-config-properties)** with **property overriding**, **[Spring support](https://www.simplejavamail.org/configuration.html#section-spring-support)** and **[Email conversion](https://www.simplejavamail.org/features.html#section-converting)** tools. Just send your emails without dealing with [RFCs](https://www.simplejavamail.org/rfc-compliant.html#navigation).

The Simple Java Mail library is a thin layer on top of [Jakarta Mail](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/mail/) that allows users to define emails on a high abstraction level without having to deal with mumbo jumbo such as 'multipart' and 'mimemessage'.

### [simplejavamail.org](https://www.simplejavamail.org) ###

Simple Java Mail is also available in [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.simplejavamail%22%20AND%20a%3A%22simple-java-mail%22):

- [#319](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/319) Replaced the underlying regex-based email-address validation library with the lexer based [JMail](https://github.com/RohanNagar/jmail), which is faster, [correcter](https://www.rohannagar.com/jmail/), documented better and is more up-to-date with RFC's
- [#367](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/367) The sendMail/testConnection methods now have proper support for `CompletableFuture`

Bugfixes:

- [#327](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/327) Implement toString() for Mailer instances for debugging purposes

#### About the migration ####

Updating to Java8/Jakarta 2.0.1 posed a challenge as the 3rd party S/MIME library [java-utils-mail-smime](https://github.com/markenwerk/java-utils-mail-smime) has been abandoned/archived while developing Simple Java Mail. Furthermore, it was still under LGPL3 license while everything else is ApacheV2.

Thankfully, I obtained permissions from the maintainers -as well as original developers from decades ago on SourceForge- to take both java-utils-mail-smime and java-utils-mail-dkim under my wings at Simple Java Mail and change the licensing model! You can now post issues and pull requests here:
- [simple-java-mail/java-utils-mail-smime](https://github.com/simple-java-mail/java-utils-mail-smime)
- [simple-java-mail/java-utils-mail-dkim](https://github.com/simple-java-mail/java-utils-mail-dkim)

The core library is now even smaller compared to the 5.x.x series going from 183kb to 134kb!

- [CLI support!!](https://www.simplejavamail.org/cli.html#navigation), 
- major performance improvement with [advanced batch processing](https://www.simplejavamail.org/configuration.html#section-batch-and-clustering) including support for mail server clusters. 
- You can now replace the final sending of emails with [your own logic](https://www.simplejavamail.org/features.html#section-custom-mailer), using a 3rd party service of your choice. 
- 6.0.0 also includes support for [S/MIME signed and encrypted emails](https://www.simplejavamail.org/features.html#section-smime)! 
- All 3rd party dependencies have been made optional by splitting up Simple Java Mail into easy to use [modules](https://www.simplejavamail.org/modules.html#navigation).
- You can now monitor and [handle async processing](https://www.simplejavamail.org/features.html#section-handling-async-result) using Futures.

#### Maintenance updates ####

Complete [Javadoc](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.simplejavamail/simple-java-mail) overhaul. Navigating the Javadoc should be much more consistent now (builder API being the single *public* source of truth).

- [#101](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/101) API backwards compatibility update, reinstate old addRecipient API as deprecated (sorry for removing it abruptly)


[v4.4.4](https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.simplejavamail%7Csimple-java-mail%7C4.4.4%7Cjar) (23-August-2017)

API usability release. **This relase streamlined the recipient setters, breaking backwards compatibility (but straightforward to fix)**

- [#95](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/95) Feature: Add support native API for setting Return-Receipt-To header
- [#93](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/93) Feature: Add support native API for setting Disposition-Notification-To header

- [#98](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/98) Bugfix: Subject and body content should be optional


[v4.3.0](https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.simplejavamail%7Csimple-java-mail%7C4.3.0%7Cjar) (12-August-2017)

Security and timeout release. 

This version safeguards against SMTP injection attack from external values entering the library through *Email* instance. Also, this release introduces default/configurable timeouts for connecting, reading and writing when sending an email.

- [#89](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/89) Support multiple delimited recipient addresses sharing the same TO/CC/BCC name
- [#88](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/88) **Safeguard subject property (and others) against SMTP CRLF injection attacks**
- [#85](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/85) **Apply configurable timeouts when sending emails**
- [#83](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/83) Parse INLINE attachments without ID as regular attachments when converting (mostly applicable to Apple emails)


[v4.2.3](https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.simplejavamail%7Csimple-java-mail%7C4.2.3%7Cjar) (21-May-2017)

- [#79](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/79): Enhancement: define custom message ID on the Email object
- [#74](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/74): v4.2.3-java-6-release: A java6 version with limited capabilities:
    I've released a customised java6 release with a customised outlook-message-parser 1.1.16-java6-release. **This is the last java6 release** I will do, as it is simply too much manual labor to create a limited second edition.

    For this edition, I've removed the JDK7 Phaser completely which has the following consequences:

    - If authenticated proxy is used, the bridging proxy server will not be shut down automatically (and might not run the second time)
    - If mails are sent in async mode, the connection pool will not be shut down anymore by itself
    
    This means your server/application might not stop properly due to lingering processes. To be completely safe, only send emails in sync mode (used by default) and don't use authenticated proxy config.


[v4.2.2](https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.simplejavamail%7Csimple-java-mail%7C4.2.2%7Cjar) (10-May-2017)

- [#73](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/73): Patch: fix for sending emails in async mode, which makes sure the connection pool is always closed when the last *known* email has been sent. Without this fix, the connection pool keeps any parent process running (main thread or Tomcat for example) until a hard kill.


[v4.2.1](https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.simplejavamail%7Csimple-java-mail%7C4.2.1%7Cjar) (12-Feb-2017)

Patch: streamlined convenience methods for adding recipients.

- [#69](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/69): Enhancement: Expanded EmailBuilder API to inlude more options for setting (multiple) recipients
- [#70](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/70): Enhancement: Most public API now have defensive null-checks for required fields (Fail Fast support)
- [#68](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail/issues/68): Bugfix: Name should be required for embedded images (added safeguards)
